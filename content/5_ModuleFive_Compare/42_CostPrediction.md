## Overview

The Cost Prediction for Inference feature aims to enhance user experience by providing transparency and predictability in terms of the costs incurred during language model inference. Users can now estimate the financial implications of their inferencing activities within LLM Lab. 

When looking at the responses that were returned from your prompt, youâ€™ll see a cost indication for each return.
