### Create Your Workspace

Once you find yourself in your LLM Labs workspace, navigate to the left menu panel. 

Select “Settings.” On this page you will be able to connect to:
1) Change your workspace name and picture
2) Create API keys
3) Enable SAML 2.0 to securitize team logins

The above 3 options are optional; you do not have to create a name for the workspace, create API keys, or enable SAML 2.0.

**REMOVE:** With the exception of _index.md, the module folders and filenames should be changed to better reflect their content, i.e. 1_Planning as the folder and 11_HowToBegin as the first submodule. Changing the "weight" value of the header is ultimately what reflects the order the modules are presented.
