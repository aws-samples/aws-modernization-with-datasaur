The search function allows you to validate the effectiveness of your knowledge base in providing context. The search results are shown in chunks that follow the chunk size and overlap value you specified when creating the vector store. Each chunk will have a similarity score along with its source. A higher similarity score means the chunk content is more related to the given prompt.
