Once the vector store is created, you can add your files for embedding by uploading them to the Knowledge Base. You can also add your files via the [External Object Storage](https://docs.datasaur.ai/llm-projects/vector-store/external-object-storage).

After you select the files, please click on the "Update Vector Store" button to initiate the embedding process. The embedding process might take some time, depending on the file size and the number of files.

After completing the embedding process, you can preview the files and use them to conduct Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in LLM Labs. In this example, we embed our sample "Patient Records," which will be used for the RAG process in LLM Labs.
