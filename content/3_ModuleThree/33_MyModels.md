# My Models <!-- MODIFY THIS HEADING -->
The **My Models** page allows you to view all deployed models and provides functionality for deploying and undeploying models.

By default, Datasaur already provides you with Direct Access LLMs that are ready to use on this My models page.

 Every new model that you deploy in the LLMs providers will be synced to Datasaur, and you can use it right away in Datasaur. If the models you just deployed haven't appeared on **My models** page, you can click the **Sync models** button.

## Undeploying models
To undeploy a model, you can click the three dots on the model card and select the Undeploy model button.

The model status will be changed into unavailable once you click the Undeploy model button.

**REMOVE:** With the exception of _index.md, the module folders and filenames should be changed to better reflect their content, i.e. 1_Planning as the folder and 11_HowToBegin as the first submodule. Changing the "weight" value of the header is ultimately what reflects the order the modules are presented.
